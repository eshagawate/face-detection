# face-detection
Human face detection has become a major field of interest in current research. Further, the
algorithms that exist are very much specific to the kind of images they would take as input
and detect faces. The problem is to detect faces in the given image which is captured in
real-time. Face detection is performed on live acquired images without any application
field in mind. To detect faces we use Resnet-101_SSD until we get the confidence of the
detected faces.
